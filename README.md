# Tours Project

#### This is a basic React project.

In this project, we fetch a list of tours, each tour contains an image of the tour sight, a price and a little description of what the tour is about.

Using conditional rendering, the text is toggled to allow to read more or show less about the tour project. The "Not interested" would allow you to delete the particular tour.

The data is being fetched from an external API.

#### Run The App Locally
